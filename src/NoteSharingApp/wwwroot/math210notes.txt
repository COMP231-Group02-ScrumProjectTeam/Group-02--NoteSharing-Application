to invert a 2x2 matrix r1[ab]r2[cd] change it into r1[d -b]r2[-c a]and multiply by 1/ad-bc
to invert a 3x3 matrix take the 3x3 matrix and put it next to a reduced echlon matrix(REM) tht looks like r1[1 0 0|0 1 0|0 0 1] then reduce the 3x3 matrix while applying the changes to the REM next to it
to determine values for a vector in Rn to be parallel to another vector solve for each var individually 
determine all scalar(linear combination prob) create a matrix where xyz is each their own column and the variables are the last column
component form of vector vector(x,y,...)|terminal pt= initial point +vector(vector is drawn from the head of the initial pt)
to finddeterminant by cofactorexpansion select each element of the matrix and find the the determinant of the elements tht arent in the same row and column. assuming[ab|cd]->ad-bc to find the determinant
the norm of a vector is sqrt(x1^2+x2^2+...)| to find the unit vector divide the vector by it's norm
linear combination is expressing a vector like --->(6,1,1)-6(1,0,0) 1(0,1,0) 1(0,0,1)
distance between R^n-vectord=sqrt((v1-u1)^2+...)direction doesnt matter in distance
dot product a dot b=ax *bx+ay*by(direction does matter so negative and positive)(only gives answer as a scalar)
to find missing angle for dot product-adotb/|a|*|b|=cos
when 2 vectors are at right angles to each other than the dot product is 0
orthogonality-the relation of two lines at right angles to one another (perpendicularity)
cross product gives u a vector answer
a × b = |a| |b| sin(?) n n is a unit vector that is perpindicular to a and b
or can be calculated this way
cx = aybz - azby
cy = azbx - axbz
cz = axby - aybx
